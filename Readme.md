# DUMB

[DUMB](https://github.com/appgurueu/DUMB) is a standalone Java application.
DUMB's main purpose is to fix PDFs exported with SMART notebook software. Additionally, documents can be converted without fixing them.
Made by Lars MÃ¼ller aka appgurueu and licensed under the MIT license.

# Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher
* "Apache OpenOffice or LibreOffice; the latest stable version is usually recommended" - [for jodconverter](https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter/wiki/System-Requirements)

Note that some conversions may take long (like PDF to FODG) as the files which need to be fixed are flawed and bloated.

# Execution

[Download the JAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appgurueu/DUMB/master/build/libs/DUMB-alpha-all.jar) and then execute it using `java -jar DUMB.jar {arguments}`.

## Command

Arguments are passed as a sequence of `<key> <value>`-pairs. Possible keys are:

* `operation`: Operation to execute - `fix`/`convert`
* `source`: source file (note: extension needs to match file type)
* `destination`: destination file (again, extension has to match type)
* `officehome`: where to find Libre Office binaries
* `background`: `fill`/`kill`/`margin`, `width`: in cm, `margin`: in cm, `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`: properties for the fixed document

If the arguments are invalid, the GUI is spawned.

### Examples

Convert a PDF into a FODG:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation convert source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.fodg"
```

Fix a PDF and replace it by the fixed one:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation fix source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf"
```

Additionally, kill the background, set a width of 30cm & a margin of 1cm:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation fix source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" background kill width 30 margin 1
```

Open the GUI:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation gui or literally everything with a different format (also zero arguments)
```
