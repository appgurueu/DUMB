# DUMB

[DUMB](https://github.com/appgurueu/DUMB) is a standalone Java application. A [demonstration](https://youtu.be/7yY4zZ9cA-c) is available on YouTube.
DUMB's main purpose is to fix PDFs exported with SMART notebook software. Additionally, documents can be converted without fixing them.
Made by Lars MÃ¼ller aka appgurueu and licensed under the MIT license.

## Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher
* "Apache OpenOffice or LibreOffice; the latest stable version is usually recommended" - [for jodconverter](https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter/wiki/System-Requirements)
    * Tested with documents generated by LibreOffice `6.3.4.2`
* Ubuntu 19.10 (runs flawlessly), some conversions may not work on Windows 10

Note that some conversions may take long (like PDF to FODG) as the files which need to be fixed are flawed and bloated.

**Files must be exported with borders in order to be fixable**, else DUMB cannot distinguish pages & page content / stuff added by the SMART software.

## Execution

[Download the JAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appgurueu/DUMB/master/build/libs/DUMB-gamma-all.jar) and then execute it using `java -jar DUMB.jar {arguments}`.

### GUI

Opens automatically if the arguments given are insufficient to start an operation.

Detailed [instructions](/res/About.html) are included within the GUI.

### Command

Arguments are passed as a sequence of `<key> <value>`-pairs. Possible keys are:

* `operation`: Operation to execute - `fix`/`convert`
* `source`: source file (note: extension needs to match file type)
* `destination`: destination file (again, extension has to match type)
* `officehome`: where to find Libre Office binaries
* `pages`: `folder`/`merge`, `background`: `fill`/`kill`/`margin`, `width`: in cm, `margin`: in cm, `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`: properties for the fixed document

If the arguments are invalid, the GUI is spawned.

#### Examples

Convert a PDF into a FODG:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation convert source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.fodg"
```

Fix a PDF and replace it by the fixed one:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation fix source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf"
```

Additionally, kill the background, set a width of 30cm & a margin of 1cm:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation fix source "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" destination "/home/user/folder/my doc.pdf" background kill width 30 margin 1
```

Open the GUI:

```bash
java -jar DUMB.jar operation gui or literally everything with a different format (also zero arguments)
```

## Versions

* `alpha`: Initial version, contained problems
* `beta`: Second version, less bugs
* `gamma`: Newest & best version, no known bugs, multiple page support
